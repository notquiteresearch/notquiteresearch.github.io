### The context

[Debate](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-50303512) continues on about whether this upcoming general election will be an election on Brexit. 

If Brexit is the defining issue of the upcoming general election, we might expect to see significant number of voters who didn't participate in the first referendum and *would* participate in a hypothetical second referendum. 


### The question 

Which of the following best describes your attitude towards a second referendum on Brexit?

### The results

- I voted last time and will vote again
- I voted last time but won't this time
- I didn't vote last time and won't this time
- I didn't vote last time but will this time
- I cannot vote


On weighted results, more than half of respondents said that they voted in the first Brexit referendum and *would* vote again in the second (17/n=30). The next most popular option? I didn't vote last time and won't vote this time (4/n=30). Only one respondent intended to change their voting behaviour: indicating that they did vote in the first Brexit referendum, but would not vote in a second referendum (1/n=30). The remainder of respondents were ineligible to vote.  

Overall, it seems that participation rates on the Brexit issue will remain steady - which makes it hard to say this is *the* Brexit election.
