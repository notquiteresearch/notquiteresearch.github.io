It seems like the same people will be voting... and the same people won't be!

For the inaugral post on NQR, I ran a survey of potential voters' habits if faced with a second Brexit referendum. 

On weighted results, more than half of respondents said that they voted in the first Brexit referendum and *would* vote again in the second. The next most popular option? I didn't vote last time and won't vote this time. 

Only one respondent out of the 30 sampled intended to change their voting behaviour: a 25-34 year old male, who indicated that they did vote in the referendum, but would not vote in a second referendum. 

Whether any of this would change the result of a second referendum is hard to say, especially given the small and decidedly unscientific sample size. But it does prompt some further thinking on whether one would expect a significant change in the tides of a vote on Brexit, if the supposed change was to be driven by hordes of apathetic voters who abstained the first time round.
