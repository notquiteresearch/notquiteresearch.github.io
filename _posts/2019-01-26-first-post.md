### The survey question 

Which of the following best describes your attitude towards a second referendum on Brexit?

- I voted last time and will vote again
- I voted last time but won't this time
- I didn't vote last time and won't this time
- I didn't vote last time but will this time
- I cannot vote

### Why? 

[Debate](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-50303512) continues on about whether this upcoming general election will be an election on Brexit. 

The idea was to see what changes might be expected in the voter participation rate if a second referendum were to be conducted.

On weighted results, more than half of respondents said that they voted in the first Brexit referendum and *would* vote again in the second. The next most popular option? I didn't vote last time and won't vote this time. 

What doe this mean for 
Only one respondent out of the 30 sampled intended to change their voting behaviour: a 25-34 year old male, who indicated that they did vote in the referendum, but would not vote in a second referendum. 

Whether any of this would change the result of a second referendum is hard to say, especially given the small and decidedly unscientific sample size. But it does prompt some further thinking on whether one would expect a significant change in the tides of a vote on Brexit, if the supposed change was to be driven by hordes of apathetic voters who abstained the first time round.
